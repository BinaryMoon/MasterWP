# [MasterWP Website](https://masterwp.co)

A Jekyll site that powers the [MasterWP](https://masterwp.co) website.

## Adding a new theme

Themes are listed on the [WordPress themes](https://masterwp.co/wordpress-themes/) page.

1. Add a new _theme.md_ file to the __themes_ directory. The filename will be used to create the page url. Use - to separate words. You can use one of the existing files as a template.
2. Add a new theme icon file to the _assets/themes/icons/_ directory. The filename should match the theme.md filename.
3. Add the theme screenshot (the one used in the theme itself) to the _assets/themes/screenshot/_ directory.
