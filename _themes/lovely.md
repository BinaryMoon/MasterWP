"Lovely" is a fresh and modern WordPress theme that can be a perfect base for a family home page, health and life style blog or even a small shop. It is very simple theme to set up and use with most of the customizing options available from the customizer.

Responsive grid is a standard these days and "Lovely" makes a good use of it to preserve its unique looks across the whole range of internet capable devices.

As a bonus this theme comes with a couple of custom page templates (including shop), color customization options and a top notch slider that will help to further customize the theme.

To keep it simple we built it using core WordPress options (pages,post and widgets) to create an easy to use site with a lot of useful features.
