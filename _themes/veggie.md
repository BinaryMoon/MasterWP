Veggie is perfectly suited for food-related sites, from recipe collections to food blogs or magazine-style sites. Veggie‘s modern, easy-to-read typography and minimalist design is a pleasure to view on devices of all sizes.

As a special treat, the theme’s demo site features a selection of healthy recipes for you to try and to share with others — including royalty-free photos of these gorgeous dishes. Bon appetit!

Veggie is responsive and displays your site in the best possible way on smartphones, tablets, and laptops, as well as large desktop screens.

## Front Page: Build Your Own

We styled the Front-Page Template in Veggie with great attention to detail, from layout options to styling and typography. The front page consists of a featured content block, page content, and three different widget areas that you can combine to create unique looks.

## Flexible Blog Layout

Veggie lets you change your blog layout in seconds. In the Customizer, choose between six different blog layouts. You can change the position of the sidebar, select a grid layout, list layout, or a full-width, no-sidebar display. Your custom layout also applies to archive pages like category and date archives.

## Page Templates

To make it easier to add variety to your site, Veggie offers several page templates:

* Front Template
* Grid Template
* Full Width, No Sidebar
* Default Template
* Right Content, No Sidebar

## Social Icons

Veggie supports social media icons for CodePen, Digg, Dribbble, Facebook, Flickr, GitHub, Google+, Instagram, Linkedin, Pinterest, RSS Feed (urls with /feed/), Tumblr, Twitter, Vimeo, WordPress, and YouTube. Linking to any of these sites will automatically display its icon in your social menu.

## Color Options

Change colors of many different theme elements with color picker in customizer.

## Widget Areas

Veggie comes with seven widget areas — one sidebar, four footer widget areas and three front-page widget areas. The widget areas will activate once you add widgets to them.
