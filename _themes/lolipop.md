Lolipop is an easy-on-the-eyes modern blogging theme with unique character. Extensive color options and a set of carefully set color presets make it easy to transform the theme from very soft and light to a very punchy one. Theme’s typography can easily be changed at any time using a custom plugin included with the theme. Different blog layouts as well as a number of front page options and templates make this theme suitable for all kinds of blogs. From lifestyle blogs to self-help or technical blogs. Theme is fully responsive and mobile friendly so your content will look great at all times, on all screen sizes.

This theme is dedicated to our friend Lola that I know since my school days. She’s always been passionate about fashion and at one point even wanted to be a fashion designer. Over the years she created an enviable collection of photos featuring her wearing different clothing combinations. With her permission we used some of those pics for this theme demo. Hope you’ll enjoy it!
