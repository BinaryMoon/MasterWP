<em>Mirror</em> is a blog-focused theme showcasing large featured images and clear typography. A prominent slider in the header helps your top content shine. <em>Mirror</em> is ideal for businesses that want to keep their audience up-to-date with their latest news. For bloggers, <em>Mirror</em> displays eye-catching images that encourage visitors to keep returning.

## Your Design, Everywhere

We designed <em>Mirror</em> to look good on all devices — from desktop computers and laptops, to smartphones and tablets.

## Featured Content Slider

<em>Mirror</em> includes support for Featured Content, allowing you to showcase the most important work, photos, or blog posts on your site. The five most recent posts tagged as featured content will be displayed in a slider on the front page of your site.

## All Languages

<em>Mirror</em> was crafted with care to work well in multiple languages, so it has full support for both left-to-right and right-to-left languages and is fully localized.

## Widget Areas

<em>Mirror</em> uses a series of custom sidebars to allow you to keep things flexible. All widget areas are invisible, until you add widgets to them.

* <strong>Footer widget area</strong> — displays at the bottom of every page on the site.
* <strong>Right sidebar widget area</strong> — displays on single posts and pages, but not the default front page or archive pages.

## Custom Templates

<em>Mirror</em> includes two custom page templates:

* <strong>Contributors</strong> — list all contributors to your website, sorted based on how many posts each person has published. Great for magazines and other multi-author blogs.
* <strong>Full-width page</strong> — displays a normal page, but with sidebars removed to have content that stretches the full width of the site.
