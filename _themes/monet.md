<em>Monet</em> is a delicate, responsive theme ideal for showcasing photography, design, and other visual-rich work. Its crisp typography ensures that your text looks just as appealing as your images.

<em>Monet</em> is perfect for travel and food blogs, or any other image-heavy site.

## A Versatile Theme

While <em>Monet</em> was designed for artists and photographers to showcase their work, it’s equally suitable for bloggers, scrapbookers, and writers who want to add a bit of visual flair to their site.

## Your Design, Everywhere

<em>Monet</em> will look great on all devices — from desktop computers and laptops to smartphones and tablets.

## Custom Post Formats

When you assign a Custom Post Format to a post, the theme will overlay a related icon on the post’s archive listing. This lets your readers know what type of content to expect from each item.

## Post Slider

<em>Monet</em> includes support for featured content — allowing you to showcase the most important work, photos, or blog posts on your site. The five most recent posts tagged as featured content will be displayed in a slider on the homepage.

## Widget Areas

<em>Monet</em> uses a series of custom sidebars to allow you to keep things flexible. All widget areas will stay hidden unless you add widgets to them.

* <strong>Footer widget area</strong> — displays at the bottom of every page on the site.
* <strong>Right sidebar widget area</strong> — displays on single posts and pages, but not the homepage or archive pages.

## Contributors Page Template

<em>Monet</em> includes the one custom page template. The Contributors Template creates a list of all of the contributors to your website sorted according to the number of posts each person has published. This features is great for magazines and other multi-author blogs.
