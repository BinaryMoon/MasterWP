Bexley is a photo oriented theme. Bexley is the perfect combination of imagery and text – and it gives photographers and artists a space to user as their online portfolio or gallery. Bexley would also be a great choice for companies that work in a visual medium – such as movies or video games.

## Accessible to All

Bexley is a fully responsive theme. What this means is that it’s designed to scale nicely with different screen sizes – all the way from a 27 inch desktop down to a tablet or smartphone screen – everything is kept readable and beautiful, allowing your readers to access the site from anywhere.

## Featured Images

Bexley makes prominent use of WordPress featured images to personalize every post. On the homepage and archive pages the images are used as the background for the post listing – with the post title prominently displayed. The featured images are also displayed at the top of each post on the single post pages. This makes the theme great as a portfolio or showcase of visual work.

## Custom Menu

By default Bexley displays your blogs pages in the navigation, if you want more flexibility then it also makes full use of WordPress custom menu functions to give you full control over the site menu.

## Widgets

Bexley supports 2 sets of custom widgets. Widgets are a powerful addition that allow you to add and arrange all sorts of flexible content containers to your site. For example you can display a list of your latest posts, or display your blogs latest comments.

The 2 sets of custom widgets are available in the right hand sidebar, and in the footer. If you decide you don’t want either of the widget areas then you can simply leave them empty and Bexley will automatically adjust content widths and positions to keep things looking nice.
