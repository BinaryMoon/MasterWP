Traveler is a theme designed for people who want to keep a visual diary of their travels. The homepage and archive pages are designed to be scannable so that readers can see what the site is about. The post pages are kept intentionally simple to keep people looking at your photos and reading about your journeys.

## Full Featured

From the huge header image (comes with three images to choose from – or upload your own), through the custom background, and the widgetized footer – Traveler has all the features you need to customise the theme to work the way you want it to.

## Flexible
Whilst Traveler was designed for travel bloggers and diarists – it’s comfortable being used as a digital scrapbook or a portfolio.

## Your Design, Everywhere

Traveler has been designed to look good on all devices – from desktop computers and laptops, through smartphones and tablets (Android and iOS). Traveler looks awesome everywhere. This is useful if you’re traveling and only have your mobile device to hand!

## Single Column Layout

The posts and pages on a Traveler site use a single column layout. This brings the focus entirely onto your content and stops people from wandering off elsewhere giving your posts and pages 100% of their attention.

## Related Posts

Traveler includes related posts after every post on the site. These are selected from recent posts in the same category and are designed to give your readers somewhere else to go once they finish reading the current post.

## Custom Sidebars

Traveler has a custom sidebar in the footer – allowing you to structure content as you wish. This sidebar will display on all pages – as long as there’s some widgets to display. If you remove the widgets then the sidebar will hide entirely.
