<em>Passenger </em>brings elements of scrapbooking to the digital realm. Everything from fonts to featured image styles helps give your content a more handmade feel, while preserving a modern, minimal aesthetic.

<em>Passenger</em> is great for travel journals and diaries; it’s also well-suited for a company blog with a focus on arts and crafts or other creative media.

The theme supports <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/portfolios/">Portfolio</a> and <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/testimonials/">Testimonial</a> post types, so you can also use the theme to showcase other types of creative work.

## Your Design, Everywhere

We designed <em>Passenger</em> to look good on all devices – from desktop computers and laptops to smartphones and tablets.

## Post Formats

<em>Passenger</em> supports several <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/posts/post-formats/">post formats</a>: <strong>image</strong>, <strong>video</strong>, <strong>gallery</strong>, and <strong>quote</strong>. Each format has a unique style for the blog, archive and search pages. This adds visual interest to your content, and helps you tell your stories more clearly.

## Widget Areas

<em>Passenger</em> has two <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/widgets/">widget</a> areas where you can add different tools and content to your site. All widget areas will stay hidden until you add widgets to them.

* <strong>Overlay widget area</strong> – This area displays on all pages in an overlay that is accessed by clicking the ellipsis (three dots) in the top-right corner of your website.
* <strong>Footer widget area</strong> – This area displays at the bottom of every page on the site.

## Contributors Template

<em>Passenger</em> includes a Contributors template, which will list all of the authors on your website, sorted by how many posts each person has published. It’s great for magazines and other multi-author blogs.
