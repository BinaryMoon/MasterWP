<em>Beacon</em> is a mobile-friendly showcase for viral content and community discussion. It’s ideal for community groups and fan clubs, whilst being equally comfortable for powering magazines.

## Social Front Page

<em>Beacon</em> is great as a destination site for communities and groups, and to help with this, we added some dynamic social functionality.

* <strong>Featured Content:</strong> The strip of content across the top of the site is the most prominent. Use this to draw people towards your most important, or enticing, articles.
* <strong>Trending Topics:</strong> <em>Beacon</em> displays categories with lots of content to help send people where you post most frequently. This is great for frequent visitors who know what they want to read.
* <strong>“Most Discussed” Tab:</strong> <em>Beacon</em> displays the top 8 posts from the last 3 months, sorted by the number of comments. This means more active posts will get extra exposure.

## Your Design, Everywhere

We designed <em>Beacon</em> to look good on all devices – from desktop computers and laptops, to smartphones and tablets.

## Front Page Categories

To feature a category grid on the front page, select the category you would like to use in the <em>Customizer</em>. The latest five posts from the category you select will be displayed. The latest post will be the largest at the top with another four posts in a grid below. This category display is perfect for magazine sites, or those with lots of varied content.

## All Languages

<em>Beacon</em> was crafted with care to work well in multiple languages, so it has full support for both left-to-right and right-to-left languages and is fully localized. If <em>Beacon</em> is not available in your language, you can find out <a href="https://prothemedesign.com/documentation/general/localization/">how to translate it here</a>.

## Theme Options

<em>Beacon</em> has a variety of options to allow you to tweak and adjust the theme so that it works exactly as you want. All options work using the <em>Customizer</em> which means you can preview the changes as you make them, safe in the knowledge that your users won’t see a broken website.

## Widget Areas

<em>Beacon</em> uses custom sidebars to allow you to keep things flexible. All widget areas will stay invisible if you don’t add widgets to them.

* <strong>Footer widget area</strong> – displays at the bottom of every page on the site.
* <strong>Right sidebar widget area</strong> – will display on the front page and single posts and pages, but not the archive pages.

## Custom Templates

<em>Beacon</em> includes custom page templates, providing additional functionality.

* <strong>Contributors</strong> – A list of all of the contributors to your website—great for magazines and other multi-author blogs—sorted according to how many posts have been published.
* <strong>Full-Width Page</strong> – A normal page without sidebars so that you can have content that stretches the full width of the site.
