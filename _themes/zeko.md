Zeko is a wonderfully designed, clean and responsive charity WordPress theme. This theme is dedicated to raising awareness that animals are sentient beings and should be treated as such. This is often not the case and we still witness a huge amount of unneeded cruelty towards our fellow earthlings. They deserve better!
