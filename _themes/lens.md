Lens is a photo-oriented theme, great for people who like to tell stories with pictures. The homepage prominently displays the featured image for each of your latest blog posts.&nbsp;Each image links to the blog post so visitors can read the accompanying text.

## Flexible

While Lens is designed for photographers and artists to showcase their work, it’s equally suitable for bloggers, scrapbookers, and writers who want to add a bit of visual flair to their site.
We designed Lens to look good on all devices – from desktop computers and laptops to smartphones and tablets.

## Infinite Content

Lens supports the latest WordPress wizardry, including infinite scroll. Infinite scroll helps to engage your readers by allowing them to see more of your content at once. If you have enabled footer widgets, then users will instead be given the option to load more posts.

## All Languages

Lens was crafted with care to work well in multiple languages, so it has full support for both left-to-right and right-to-left languages. If Lens is not available in your language, you can find out how to translate it here.

## Custom Headers and Backgrounds

Lens gives you the ability to upload your own header images via <em>Appearance → Header</em>. You can also customize your blog with a background color or image by going to <em>Appearance → Background</em>.

## Widget Areas

Lens offers two widget areas:

* Footer widget area – will stay invisible if you don’t add any widgets to it. This widget area will display on all pages.
* Right sidebar widget area will display on blog posts only, it will not show on the homepage, pages, or in the archives. This widget area will stay hidden if no widgets are added to it.
