## Introduction
Showcase is the perfect Easy Digital Downloads theme, making it quick and easy to create a beautiful site to sell your downloadable products online.

## Customizable homepage
Showcase's easy to set up homepage has 8 different content sections with a choice of 10 content types - all configured with a couple of mouse clicks directly from the Customizer. Content types you can display on your homepage include:

* Featured downloads
* Recent downloads
* Download categories with category image
* Pricing tables
* Feature icons
* Recent blog posts
* Widget areas
* Standard page content

## Unique hero banner
Showcase has a unique hero banner feature that allows you to really show off your products. Upload a background image, then insert a featured image or video on top. Finish it off with the page title, subtitle and meta data to provide a visually memorable experience for your users.

## WordPress standards
Showcase is built to WordPress standards, meaning it has just the features you need without any bloat. All your options are set through the Customizer so you can preview your site before it goes live.

## Terrific typography
It almost goes without saying that Showcase supports over 600 free fonts via Google Fonts. However, it also supports your Typekit subscription, giving you access to even more great looking fonts.

## Page templates and layouts
Showcase has several page templates, including full width, single column and sidebar (left or right). Additionally, you can choose separate blog archive and single layouts, and different layouts for download archives and pages.

## Custom widget areas
To support the various page layout options, Showcase has several custom widget areas, giving you options for different sidebars based on the page or post type.
