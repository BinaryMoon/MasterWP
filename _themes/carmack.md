<em>Carmack</em> is a magazine theme that is perfect for entertainment based sites. Whether that is video games, music, movies or tv. The large thumbnails and post slider have a striking appearance that really makes you content shine. <em>Carmack</em> supports Featured Content and Post Formats to allow you to create the perfect website.

## Your Design, Everywhere

We designed <em>Carmack</em> to look good on all devices — from desktop computers and laptops, to smartphones and tablets.</p>

## Post Formats

<em>Carmack</em> supports several Post Formats: image, video, gallery, audio, and quote. Each format has a unique style for the blog, archive, and search pages. This visually distinguishes your types of content, and helps you tell your stories in distinct ways.

## Featured Content Slider

<em>Carmack</em> includes support for Featured Content, so you can showcase the most important work/photos/blog posts on your site. The most recent posts tagged as featured content will be displayed in a slider on the homepage and in a grid underneath the slider if there are more than five featured posts.

## Theme Options

<em>Carmack</em> has a variety of options to tweak and adjust the theme so that it works exactly as you want. All options work using the Customizer, which means you can preview the changes as you make them, safe in the knowledge that your users won’t see a broken website.

## Widget Areas

<em>Carmack</em> offers several widget areas to allow you to keep things flexible, in the sidebar, footer, or slideout panel. All widget areas stay hidden unless you add widgets to them.

## Custom Templates

<em>Carmack</em> includes four custom page templates for varying your content display: Contributors, Full-Width Page, Projects, and a Child Page Grid.
