<em>Inspiro</em> is a professional photo and video focused theme with a modern design. Packed with features including a fullscreen slideshow that supports YouTube & self-hosted videos in background, widgetized homepage and gallery module, Inspiro is perfect for showing off your portfolio, images and videos.

## Page Builder Integration

One of the most exciting additions to Inspiro is the support for a drag-and-drop **Page Builder**. Install the free **Unyson** plugin and enjoy drag-and-drop layout customization. Inspiro is tightly integrated for ease of use. ![inspiro-builder-1](https://www.wpzoom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/inspiro-builder-1.png) We want to make using the drag and drop **Page Builder** easy for you, so we've included **four pre-built templates** which you can import to Inspiro with just one click. Below you can see a few examples of pages created using the Page Builder:

* [Business Homepage](http://demo.wpzoom.com/inspiro-agency/)
* [Agency Homepage](http://demo.wpzoom.com/inspiro/homepage-2/) - _this one is very similar to default widgetized homepage_
* [About](http://demo.wpzoom.com/inspiro/about-2/)
* [Services](http://demo.wpzoom.com/inspiro/services/)

## Video Lightbox in Homepage Slideshow

Inspiro comes with a beautiful video lightbox integrated in the homepage slideshow where you can feature **YouTube** or **Vimeo** videos.
