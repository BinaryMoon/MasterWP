Mimbo Pro is a magazine theme for WordPress.&nbsp;Unlike a traditional blog theme it takes your content and formats it in a structured way grouped by category. Using all of the standard WordPress functionality, custom headers, custom backgrounds, post thumbnails, custom navigation and more – Mimbo Pro makes your content look awesome.

## Featured Content

At the top of the homepage is a featured content space. This lets you show off your most important content. By default you Mimbo Pro displays all posts here – however you can restrict the content to specific categories by using the theme control panel – and selecting a featured category.

## Slider

Mimbo Pro features a homepage carousel that shows off your featured content. You can edit the carousel settings through the theme options.

The carousel options allow you to change the carousel categories, the scroll speed of the category. 0 = no automatic scrolling, and a number greater than 0 is the amount of time to pause between scrolling. If you want you can also hide the carousel by selecting the hide option in the category selection.


## Category Summaries

Mimbo Pro allows you to display your categories on the homepage along with the 4 latest posts. We call this section the category summaries. By default all categories are displayed, however you can limit the theme to specific categories through the control panel.

## Custom Sidebars

Mimbo Pro uses a series of custom sidebars to allow you to keep things nice and flexible.

* <strong>Sidebar Left</strong> – the default left hand sidebar.
* <strong>Sidebar Right</strong> – the right hand sidebar as displayed on the homepage.
* <strong>Sidebar Single Post Left</strong> – the left hand sidebar to use on single post pages. This is optional, if you leave it empty then the <em>Sidebar Left</em> will be used.
* <strong>Sidebar Single Post Right</strong> – This is another optional sidebar. Leave it empty and it will be hidden. Add widgets and it will be displayed on the single posts pages within the post content.
* <strong>Bottom Widgets</strong> – footer widgets. These will be displayed side by side in the footer. It’s recommended that you use 3 widgets since there are three columns, however you can use as many as you like.

## Custom Templates

* <strong>Archives</strong> – A chronological list of all posts published on your blog.
* <strong>Full Width Page</strong> – A normal WordPress page, only it has the sidebars removed so that you can have content that stretches the full width of the site.
