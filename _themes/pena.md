<p>This theme has been inspired by "Living On One Dollar" documentary we watched one night. We were deeply touched and wanted to somehow contribute to the whole project. As theme developers we decided to develop a WordPress theme to help spread the word about it. Pena is modern, responsive and mobile friendly theme. Theme offers whole variety of cool features like different blog layouts, different header options, extensive color options and more. Pena is all very easily customizable directly from the WordPress Customizer. Pena also comes with number of page templates and includes a couple specially styled to support hugely popular plugins like Give, WooCommerce and The Events Calendar.</p>
