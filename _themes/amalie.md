"Amalie" is a feature rich, designed premium blogging theme built upon the free "Twenty Fifteen" WP theme. Responsive grid is a standard these days and "Amalie" makes a good use of it to preserve it looks across the whole range of internet capable devices. As a bonus this theme comes with a couple of custom page templates & color customization options that will help to further customize the theme. To keep it simple we built it using core WordPress options (pages,post and widgets) to create an easy to use site with a lot of useful features.
