## What is MasterWP?

MasterWP is a weekly email for WordPress professionals - currently sent to over **{{ site.subscribers }}** subscribers!

Each week we find five interesting articles, resources and apps that help WordPress users and developers to be better at their job.

There are a lot of places to find WordPress news; MasterWP stands out by finding readers the very best articles.

We often pick out content that is not WordPress specific but may be of interest or useful. These cover things such as productivity, web development techniques, personal development, and business advice.

The first issue of MasterWP was published on Wednesday February 2nd 2017, and a new issue has gone out every week since.

## Audience

The MasterWP emails are read by WordPress professionals, and we have significant influence in the WordPress community.

Emails are very well received, and get 25-35% open rate, and a 10% click rate - both of which are very good for weekly email newsletters.

50% of our audience are from the USA, 10% are from the UK, the remaining 40% are spread around the world. This shows that our emails have a good reach with native English speaking users.

## Sponsorship

There are two options for sponsoring MasterWP: the main sponsor slot (you're the single main sponsor for four weeks, at the top of the email), and classified ads (you're one of many, for two weeks, and among multiple sponsors).

The main sponsor slot is our most popular option, and we'd recommend getting in touch to book early as this can get booked up.

Here's a [sample issue showing the main sponsor slot](https://getellipsis.com/?mailpoet_router&endpoint=view_in_browser&action=view&data=WzUwLDAsMCwwLDAsMV0).
