## What is MasterWP?

MasterWP is a weekly email for WordPress Masters. We strive to find 5 interesting articles that help WordPress users and developers to be better at their job. There are a lot of places to find WordPress news so we try to focus on finding the best articles. We also pick out content that is not WordPress specific but may be of interest or useful. These cover things such as productivity, web development techniques, personal development, and business advice.

The first issue of MasterWP was published on February 2nd 2017, and we have posted a new issue every Wednesday since.

## Audience

The MasterWP emails are targeted at WordPress professionals. Each email has an average of a 40% open rate, and a 10% click rate - both of which are on the high side for weekly email newsletters.

50% of our audience are from the USA, 10% are from the UK, the remaining 40% are spread around the world. This however shows that our emails have a good reach with native English speaking users.

## Sponsorship

Each issue of MasterWP is sponsored by a different company. Sponsors get:

* The sole advert spot in the issue(s) they sponsor
* A shout out on the MasterWP Facebook page

## Rates

The rates increase as the subscriber numbers increase. Currently the rates are low since the emails are new and we reserve the right to increase the rates at any time.

The introductory rates are:

* $25 per issue
* $75 for a block of 4 issues (buy 3 get 1 free)
