description: Looking for a T-Shirt Designer
---
I am looking for someone to help me design some t-shirts for [MasterWP](https://masterwp.co) and my theme shop [Pro Theme Design](https://prothemedesign.com).

I want something classy that features the logo, ideally the url, and some funky patterns/ illustrations that fit the brand.

I want it to be something I won't be embarassed to wear; such as the examples below ðŸ˜ƒ

<img src="{{ "/assets/images/t-shirts/tshirts.jpg" | relative_url }}" class="tshirt-image" />

I would like something that is a single colour, and so can be used in many situations. I will provide vector versions of the logos in a single colour for use in the design.

The designs are primarily for T-Shirts for me and Alex to wear at conferences. We may also use them on stickers/ mugs etc.

I am open to creative or unusual ideas and have a small budget for getting the designs made.

If you are interested then please send me an email, with a quote, and examples of similar designs you have done, to [hello@masterwp.co](mailto:hello@masterwp.co).
